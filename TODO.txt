Todo list for quickdot
-----------------

DONE 2018-03-14 Start adding colors
 white: system isolated. Does not depend on the pre-loading of any other systems to work
 red: system that depends on another single system. Both must be loaded by quicklisp to work.
 orange: system with two dependencies
 violet: three dependencies


Accept individual systems as argument (first try still very slow)
